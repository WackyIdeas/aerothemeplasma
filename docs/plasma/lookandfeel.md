# Global Theme (Look and Feel)

Components that are relevant to ATP:

- Splash screen
- Logout screen

## Splash screen details

- The background image is loaded from ATP's SDDM theme (`/usr/share/sddm/themes/sddm-theme-mod/bgtexture.jpg`)

## Logout screen details 

The logout screen has been repurposed into the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen, as the logout screen gets spawned when using the shortcut, and a logout screen wasn't a thing after Windows XP.
